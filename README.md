# Water Quality Analysis and Potability Prediction

This project analyzes water quality parameters and predicts whether the water is **safe for human consumption (potable)** using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest Classifiers**. The dataset used is the **Water Potability dataset**, which contains various chemical and physical water quality metrics.

## Project Overview

Water quality is a crucial factor for maintaining public health. This project aims to:
1. Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the given dataset to understand feature distributions and correlations.
2. Handle **missing values** and perform **data preprocessing**.
3. Build **machine learning models** (Decision Tree and Random Forest) to classify water as **potable (1)** or **non-potable (0)**.
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Used

- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
  Used to create a simple interpretable model that splits data based on feature thresholds.

- **Random Forest Classifier**  
  An ensemble model combining multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
